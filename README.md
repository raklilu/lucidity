lucidity
========

<a src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream">Lucid dreaming</a> is being able to actively control your dreams. The key to enabling this is to be aware that you are in your dream. This project utilizes Arduino to help build a sleep mask that will achieve this. 

How it will work:
When you fall into the REM cycle of sleep, you are dreaming. This is regardless of whether or not you remember your dream when you wake up. The idea is to have a sleep mask notify you when you are entering REM so you know you are beginning a dream. The sleep mask will make a guess as to when REM cycle begins based on the time a person begins his/her sleep. Eventually, this will be improved by allowing more customized REM guesses by age, average sleep time, etc.
